# background
Analyzing social media data donations, so-called Data Download Packages (DDPs) made available to users, are increasingly becoming a popular method to study online user engagement and experience. While many promising new initiatives have emerged to scale data donations, explore various quantitative analyses, and provide robust ethical guidelines, our project seeks to critically reflect on what such data may, or may not, reveal within the audience studies tradition. Following longstanding critiques of using commercially generated data, this project seeks to methodologically ground data donations research within the critical audience studies tradition and present a step-by-step method for utilizing social media data donations for more qualitative and reflexive audience research.
